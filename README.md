# transport-booking-system
Project for the course Web Accessibility at Mid Sweden University. The task is to make a website with a booking system for a fictive transport company.

In Sweden we have a transport system called "F채rdtj채nst" which is a system for booking transports when you have some sort of disability that makes it difficult to 
use public transportation or driving your own car. The transport is a sort of taxi, if the user has assistants or equipment like wheelchairs, the transport have room for that.

I tried to make the design to be as accessible as possible. I use large fonts so it would be easy to navigate for people with visual impairments. I have a very minimalistic graphic design with few colors, some have problems to concentrate for various reasons and I believe that a minimalistic website will be easier to navigate. I used myself as a reference here, because I have a hard time to focus if a website have too many colors, animations, pictures and texts. 

I choose the name "Florence F채rdtj채nst" and my inspiration is the historical nurse Florence Nightingale. A nurse is a symbol for caring I can imagine, and I want this transport company to give the vibe of being safe and comfortable. The logotype is a Nightingale which I made in Figma and Photopea.
